Title: Fusion Node—Liquidity + Gamma + Time

Type: Black Box / Microstructure

Version: 1.0

Status: Proven

Mentor-Grade Definition:
Combine macro liquidity nodes, gamma “magnet” levels, and time array for super-confluence high-probability pivots. Edge fires at exact intersection of all three overlays, yielding rare but potent reversals or expansions.

---

Atomic Workflow / Rules:
1. Overlay all macro liquidity levels (OBs, FVGs, session levels).
2. Mark gamma pins and major expiry levels.
3. Identify exact time window (e.g., 10am, 2:30pm) for confluence.
4. Enter only at full alignment; size up and exit on strong reaction.

---

Validation / Falsification:
- Valid: Expansion, reversal, or pivot at super-confluence.
- Invalid: One overlay missing, or confluence is weak.

---

Example / Case Study:
SPX hits max gamma at HTF FVG at 2:30pm—trend reverses sharply.

QA Pair (Mentor-Level):
Q: How rare is this alignment?
A: Very rare, but extremely high edge when present.
