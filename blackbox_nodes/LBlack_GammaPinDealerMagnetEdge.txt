Title: Gamma Pin / Dealer Magnet Edge

Mentor-Grade Definition:
Dealer net gamma exposure at key strikes creates a “magnet” for price, pinning to max open interest/gamma until expiry, then enabling trend post-expiry. Key institutional edge for mean reversion and post-expiry regime shifts.

---

Atomic Workflow / Rules:
1. Download OI/gamma by strike for main asset (SPX, NQ, ES, etc.).
2. Overlay strike OI on price/time chart.
3. Fade mean-reverting moves toward pin strike pre-expiry.
4. Trade trend breakout post-expiry as dealer gamma flips/unwinds.

---

Validation / Falsification:
- Valid: Price pins at max gamma/OI, then trends after expiry.
- Invalid: No pin effect; price trends despite gamma.

---

Example / Case Study:
SPX pinned to 4100, then breaks 4120 after OPEX as gamma hedges unwind.

QA Pair (Mentor-Level):
Q: What if no live OI/gamma data is available?
A: Use delayed CBOE data, SpotGamma, or IV skew as proxies.
