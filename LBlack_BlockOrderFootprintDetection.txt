Title: Block Order Footprint Detection

Type: Black Box / Microstructure

Version: 1.0

Date: 2025-05-17

Status: Proven

Mentor-Grade Definition:
Large funds split trades, but “footprints” appear as persistent volume clusters at key prices; edge is to trade with the breakout after the footprint is confirmed.

---

Atomic Workflow / Rules:
1. Mark levels with persistent large prints and small net range.
2. Enter on expansion after final absorption or “push.”
3. Confirm direction with OI delta or footprint chart.
4. Exit at next liquidity node or risk level.

Validation / Falsification:
- Valid: Price accelerates after cluster breaks.
- Invalid: Cluster is fake, price retraces.

Example / Case Study:
AAPL trades 1m shares at $190 with no movement; finally pops $1 as block finishes.
