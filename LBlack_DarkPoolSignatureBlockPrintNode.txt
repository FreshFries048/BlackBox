Mentor-Grade Definition:
Hidden institutional orders (blocks, VWAP, dark pool trades) create “signature” prints or delayed price effects in the lit market. Detecting these flows reveals delayed price drift or trend initiation.

---

Atomic Workflow / Rules:
1. Monitor time & sales for large prints off-market or odd-lot prints at key levels.
2. Watch for volume surges with minimal visible size on Level 2.
3. Fade or ride after-effect—if a big buy, look for delayed drift up; if a big sell, drift down.
4. Log block prints and follow-through for pattern analysis.

---

Validation / Falsification:
- Valid: Large dark print is followed by delayed directional move.
- Invalid: No effect, or dark print is paired/hedged immediately.

---

Example / Case Study:
AAPL shows 500k dark print at $180; next hour, price drifts up 0.5%.

QA Pair (Mentor-Level):
Q: Not all dark prints are directional—how to filter?
A: Focus on persistent one-sided prints at support/resistance, not matched crosses.
